# Offline-Signature-Verification-Using-Neural-Network-Technology

This solution will help in tackling frogery. In this I have used Deep learning techniques to make a solution for verifying signatures.

The training dataset comprises of information assembled from open sources, ex-plicitly from stages like Kaggle. It incorporates data from 30 people who have both genuine and forged signature. Every individual has a sum of 10 marks, with 5 being genuine signature that they have made themselves and 5 being forged signature made by another person.
